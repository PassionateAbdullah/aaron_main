# ü§ñ Aeron - AI-Powered Process Analysis Assistant

Aeron is a sophisticated, AI-powered chatbot designed to provide intelligent analysis of business processes and KPIs. It leverages the power of Google's Gemini models and FAISS for efficient similarity search to deliver accurate and context-aware responses. Aeron can also analyze process event logs, generate KPI reports, and provide insights into process bottlenecks and loops.

    ```

## Usage

### Chatbot

To start the chatbot, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The chatbot will load the knowledge base from the `landing.json` file and build a FAISS index. You can then start asking questions about your business processes and KPIs.

### KPI Report Generation

To generate a KPI report, run the following command:

```bash
python report_generator.py
```

The script will use the sample data from the `data.py` file to generate a KPI report package in JSON format.

### Process Analysis

To analyze a process event log, run the following command:

```bash
python y.py
```

The script will use the sample data from the `invoice_process_expanded (1).csv` file to analyze the process and generate a structured process flow output in JSON format.
